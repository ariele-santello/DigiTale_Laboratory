          <br>
          <div class="text-black">The idea of the project was born from the will of improving the fruition of cultural objects, specifically of books.
          The technologies used in the website are aimed at showing new perspective of the object, highlighting some details, but also at promoting
        the use of standards for the conservation and the interoperability.
        <br>
        The 3D model of the book i choose as the subject of the project was created trough the use of the Zephyr3D photogrammetry software.
        <br>
        Pictures were taken with a Nikon D3100 in order to control in abetter way the exposition value of each photo. The shooting technoique was choosen
        following the proposal of the standard photographic acquisition: moving around the subject and keeping the camera in a fixed position, using the same camera objective and without changing the zoom setting.
        <br>
        Undoubtedly, 3D modeling is a valuable resource for cultural heritage, since it provides key benefits for the conservation, documentation, recreation and analysis of cultural assets.
        <br>
        Creating cultural digital resources with proper documentation and metadata allows easy use, reuse, analysis and archiviation of cultural heritage objects, enhancing the way of taking care and working with cultural heritage.
        <br>
        Another important aspect is that by the digital recreation of cultural objects provides the possibility to get access to cultural heritage sites and cultural heritage material to people. The possibility of having digital models of all these cultural assets makes them more accessible for people, since the physical access to most of these objects and places is restricted or hard to reach.
        Furthermore, 3D modeling allows a modern way of interaction between people and cultural materials or cultural heritage sites. It has become in a new way to access cultural assets and cultural information, transforming the approach people and scholars have in relation to cultural heritage.
        another vital aspect of cultural heritage is that it is a public asset.

        <h3 class="h4 mb-2"> IIIF Manifest and Viewer</h3>
        <br>
        IIIF stands for the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF).
        The IIIF specifications are developed in a process that takes in consideration the users of image resources and their needs.
        They are based on standards that help archives, libraries, and museums make the most of their digitized collections with deep zoom, annotation capabilities, let them joining a global network of image suppliers making content available in a common, interoperable framework.
        <br>
        IIIF uses RESTful API construction, JSON-LD, and follows Web patterns, simplifying processes for data migration and sharing.
        <br>
        The IIIF standards are a set of shared application programming interface (API) specifications for interoperable functionality in digital asset repositories. Using JSON-LD, linked data, and standard W3C web protocols such as Web Annotation, IIIF makes it easy to parse and share digitized materials, migrate across technology systems, and provide enhanced image access for scholars and researchers.
        In short, IIIF enables better, faster and cheaper image delivery.
        <br>
        It lets you leverage interoperability and to access new possibilities and new users for your image-based resources, while reducing long term maintenance and technological lock in. IIIF gives users a rich set of baseline functionality for viewing, zooming, and assembling the best mix of resources and tools to view, compare, manipulate and work with images on the Web, an experience made portableâ€“shareable, citable, and embeddable.
